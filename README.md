# Secure And Private AI Scholarship Challenge by Facebook
## Lesson 2 (Complete)
I have completed the following tasks on this lesson:
- Single Layer Neural Network using PyTorch.
- Multi Layer Neural Network Using both nn.Sequential and Functional Call of PyTorch.
- Feed Forward Networks and Back Propagation Model.
- Learned about optimization and Autograd functionality of PyTorch.
- Worked on Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Learned the use of Inference & Validation in Neural Network Model.
- Data Augmentation using Transforms.
- Transfer Learning

## Lesson 3
So far I have completed the following tasks on this lesson:
- Created Parallel Databases from a dataset.
- Learned about sensitivity. Sensitivity is basically measures how much a result changes for a database if one of its data is changed.
- Calculated L1 Sensitivity for threshold
- Learned about differencing attack. It is basically a technique to distinguish the features of a single data entry by asking various queries.
- In privacy, noise is added to dataset to keep the data entries private.
- Learned about Local Differential Privacy. If noise is added on every data entry of a dataset, then that is called local differential Privacy. It is very secured. But, not much accurate.
- Learned about Global Differential Privacy. If noise is added on output only, then that is called global differential privacy.
- Used global differential privacy on a deep learning model.
- Learned about PATE analysis.
- Right now, reading the book of Cynthia Dwork on Privacy. [https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf]
Yet to complete:
- A project using PATE Analysis on MNIST Dataset.
